    "It is important for [Avito](https://www.avito.ru/rossiya?verifyUserLocation=1) (Russian Craigslist) and its users to know the probability of success (our target; e.g. selling the item/service) upon creating their listings. We are helping both Avito and its customers with our model. This challenge was an exciting opportunity for us to gain experience while doing data wrangling, feature extraction, model training and ensembling of those models using different kinds of data that you see in the notebooks below. Also a presentation of our results is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16jHh03UMRoGotGNfu7kN1aWJ81upqqyfPk3zm2H7rbs/edit?usp=sharing).\n",
