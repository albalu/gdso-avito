# gdso-avito
Predicting the demand for listed items in Avito (Russian Craigslist) from a
combination of tabular, text and image data. This is for example to set the
seller's expectation based on their listing.

This is a Kaggle competition ( https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-demand-prediction )
that we do during the data science workshop held by graduate data science organization (GDSO) where students and postdocs form
 teams of 4 mentored by data scientists from industry to work on some practical
 problems while learning to use their data science skills, network and have fun!

 This project is mentored by Joel Barajas ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-barajas-bb06b78/ ).
